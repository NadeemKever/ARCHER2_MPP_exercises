# ARCHER2_MPP_exercises
A collection of C++ code that solves the ARCHER2 Message-Passing Programming MPI [course](https://epcced.github.io/MPI_Intro_Self_Service/). 

The specific exercies are found [here](https://epcced.github.io/MPI_Intro_Self_Service/_downloads/f4a28b40e98ecced2d972ef0d9579e44/MPP-exercises.pdf).

In addition, I also provide the code to solve the case study in the final module of the course.
